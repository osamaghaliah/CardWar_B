**Introduction -** _War is a cards game that is played between two players such that a stack of 52 cards is divided equally between them._

**How To Play -** _After dividing the stack on the two players, a one single round is played as follows - each player sets his stack (which consists of 26 cards) to be faced down. Then, each player pulls one card of his stack and reveals it, the owner of the card with the higher rank wins both cards and puts them aside. The game ends once one of the players stack is empty (0 cards left), at this point, the player who won a bigger number of cards is the winner._

> **NOTICE:** _A card of rank 2 defeats a card of rank Ace._

**Draw Occurence -** _In case that the two players pulled cards of the same rank, it is considered a draw for the current round. What do we do ?_
_Each player pulls a new card from his stack without revealing it (facing down) and sets it on the former card (that caused a draw) and pulls another card by revealing it (facing up). Here, the players simply get back to comparing their cards by the rank - if another draw has occured, the same steps as before must be performed on the stack that started to be accumulated, if NO draw occured, the winner of the current round wins the whole cards that were being bet on._
